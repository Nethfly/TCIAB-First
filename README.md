## A short story of me

---

My name is John I am (put your age here).... I'm not going to tell you my age, that's so rude. I am from this beautiful city **Bogot√°** which I love with my heart. Since I was a kiddo I love videogames, the sports, especifically the extreme sports, that is the reason why I practice Enduro (and I have two broken bones) on weekends, of course, when I have enough time to do it. Regarding videogames, gosh, if I'm not wrong, when I was a little boy I _"borrowed"_ 20 pesos coins from my dad just to go to the arcade machine next to my home to play Super Mario.

My favorite videogames are:

- Resident Evil
- Silent Hill
- Metal Gear Solid
- The Last Of Us (and the list continues)

One more thing, I am huge fan of Star Wars, the movies, the prequels, and some other content that I haven't seen yet. If I have to categorize my favorite Star Wars movies, it will be like this:

1. A New Hope
2. The Empire Strikes Back
3. Return of The Jedi
4. The Clone Wars
5. Star Wars Rebels

Well, that's a short story of me, If you want to know more about me, just ask, it's free and unlimited.
